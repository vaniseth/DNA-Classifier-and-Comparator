# DNA-Classifier-and-Comparator

This is DNA Classifer and a comparator project where we are checkinf DNA sequences using various CLassification algorithms.

The dataset used for this project is from UCI Machine Learning that has 100 DNA sequences and 57 seqential algorithms.

**ABOUT THE DATA**

A nucleotide is the basic building block od nucleic acids. RNA and DNA are polymers made of long chains of nucleotides.A nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule attached to a phospate group of a nitrigen-containing base.
The bases in DNA are Adenin (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymin (T). 
In RNA, the base Uracil (U) takes the place of Thymine.
  
**DNA SEQUENCING**: Sequencing DNA means determining the order of the four chemical building blocks - called "bases" - that make up the DNA molecule.
The sequence tells the scientist the kind of gentic information that is carried in a particular DNA segment.
